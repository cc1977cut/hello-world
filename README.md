# hello-world
open mind , no knowledge , pro-novice
Obsession and mental health finally have their way ....... I'm present , I'm focussed and at the start of 
a new chapter . I'm here for me , profession and practical experience currently on hold . Not my motivation for being here anyway.

Hopefully further down the line .... I can liase and possibly contribute a little code but currently just imagination
and fuck lets face a few questions , certainly hope to and welcome the chance to liase with you all . Your experience and patience would be much appreciated.

I certainly can't move forward when not sure which direction I'm facing . 
Professional Novice ....finally a title I'm comfortable with

respect all
